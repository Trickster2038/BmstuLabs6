This
is
called
supervised
learning,
because
the
process
of
learning
an
algorithm
from
a
set
of
training
data
can
be
considered
as
a
teacher
controlling
the
learning
process.
We
know
the
correct
answers;
the
algorithm
iteratively
makes
predictions
on
the
training
data
and
is
corrected
by
making
updates.
Training
stops
when
the
algorithm
reaches
an
acceptable
level
of
performance.
Supervised
learning
problems
can
be
further
grouped
into
regression
and
classification
problems.
Classification:
The
classification
problem
is
that
the
output
variable
is
a
category,
for
example:
red"
and
"blue"
or
"disease"
and
"no
disease".
regression:
A
regression
problem
where
the
output
variable
is
a
real
value,
such
as
"dollars"
or
"weight.
The
above
example
is
a
regression
problem.
